## Introduction

This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding data structures and OOP concepts in C++. You can find well-commented code implementations, explanations, and examples to help you grasp these fundamental programming concepts.

## Data Structures

Explore various data structures implemented in this repository:

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, etc.)
- Graphs
- Hash Tables

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Learn about key OOP principles, including:

- Classes and Objects
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Encapsulation
- Abstraction

## Usage

Clone the repository to your local machine using: git clone https://github.com/Jacinth-Mahanta/Data-Structures-and-OOPs-in-CPP.git

Navigate to the specific data structure or OOP concept folder and explore the code examples. Each folder contains a `README.md` file explaining the implementation and usage.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you want to add more data structures, enhance existing implementations, or provide better explanations, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -m 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin feature/new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request.
